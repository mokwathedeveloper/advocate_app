### 4. **Test Real-time Messaging**

**For this test, you'll need two browser windows/tabs:**

#### Window 1 (User A):
1. Login as User A
2. Go to Messages
3. Create or select a conversation

#### Window 2 (User B):
1. Login as User B (different account)
2. Go to Messages
3. Select the same conversation

#### Test Messaging:
1. **Send a message** from User A
2. **Verify** it appears instantly in User B's window
3. **Send a reply** from User B
4. **Verify** it appears instantly in User A's window

✅ **Expected Behavior:**
- Messages should appear instantly without page refresh
- Message delivery status should show (sent → delivered → read)
- Timestamps should be accurate

### 5. **Test Typing Indicators**

1. In one window, **start typing** a message (don't send)
2. In the other window, you should see **"[User] is typing..."**
3. **Stop typing** - indicator should disappear after 3 seconds

✅ **Expected Behavior:**
- Typing indicator appears when user starts typing
- Shows user's name who is typing
- Disappears when user stops typing or sends message

### 6. **Test Online Status**

1. **Close one browser window** (simulating user going offline)
2. In the remaining window, **check user status**
3. **Reopen the closed window** (user comes back online)
4. **Verify status updates**

✅ **Expected Behavior:**
- Online indicator (green dot) should appear/disappear
- Status should update in real-time
- "Last seen" timestamp should be accurate

### 7. **Test Message Features**

#### Message Input:
- **Enter key** sends message
- **Shift+Enter** creates new line
- **Auto-resize** textarea as you type
- **File attachment** button (placeholder)
- **Emoji button** (placeholder)

#### Message Display:
- **Own messages** appear on the right (blue)
- **Other messages** appear on the left (gray)
- **Timestamps** show for each message
- **Sender names** show in group conversations
- **Message status** indicators for sent messages

### 8. **Test Error Handling**

#### Network Issues:
1. **Disconnect internet** briefly
2. **Try sending a message**
3. **Reconnect internet**
4. **Verify** automatic reconnection

✅ **Expected Behavior:**
- Connection status should show "Disconnected" → "Reconnecting" → "Connected"
- Failed messages should be handled gracefully
- Automatic reconnection should work

#### Invalid Actions:
1. **Try accessing** conversation without permission
2. **Send empty messages**
3. **Search with very short queries**

✅ **Expected Behavior:**
- Appropriate error messages should appear
- System should remain stable
- No crashes or broken states

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### 1. **"Please log in to access messages"**
- **Solution**: Make sure you're logged in with a valid account
- Check browser console for authentication errors

#### 2. **"Failed to connect to chat service"**
- **Solution**: Verify backend server is running on port 5000
- Check MongoDB connection
- Verify JWT token is valid

#### 3. **Messages not appearing in real-time**
- **Solution**: Check browser console for Socket.IO errors
- Verify both users are in the same conversation
- Check network connectivity

#### 4. **User search not working**
- **Solution**: Verify backend API is responding
- Check if users exist in database
- Ensure search query is at least 2 characters

#### 5. **Typing indicators not showing**
- **Solution**: Verify Socket.IO connection is active
- Check if both users are online
- Ensure conversation is properly joined

## 📊 Performance Testing

### Load Testing (Optional):
1. **Open multiple browser tabs** (5-10)
2. **Login with different accounts** in each tab
3. **Send messages simultaneously**
4. **Monitor performance** and responsiveness

✅ **Expected Behavior:**
- System should handle multiple concurrent users
- Messages should still deliver quickly
- No significant performance degradation

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The chat system is working correctly if:

✅ **Real-time messaging** works between users  
✅ **Typing indicators** appear and disappear correctly  
✅ **Online status** updates in real-time  
✅ **Message delivery** status is accurate  
✅ **User search** and conversation creation works  
✅ **Automatic reconnection** handles network issues  
✅ **Error handling** is graceful and informative  
✅ **Performance** is responsive with multiple users  

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Check backend terminal** for server errors
3. **Note the specific steps** that caused the issue
4. **Document expected vs actual behavior**
